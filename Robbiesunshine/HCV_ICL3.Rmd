Validation of Hepatitis C viral count using R-computing
========================================================

This is a test

```{r,echo=FALSE, results='hide'}


# libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(corrgram)
library(MethComp)

# read file
source("HCV_ICL3.R")
View(HCV_ICL3)
```
In a summary. The lower limit of detection (LLD) at home-lab is 12 IU/ml and the LLD at the reference-lab os 20 IU/ml. So, if the result is <20IU/ml, the detected value could be anywhere between 1 and 20. Therefore, the lower limit of detection has been set for home-lab at '6 IU/ml' and '10 IU/ml' for the reference lab. 

```{r Summary}
summary(HCV_ICL3)
head(HCV_ICL3)
```
To make it more easy, the set of values from Reference-lab = 'x'. The set of values from Home-lab = 'y' 
```{r,echo=FALSE}
x <- HCV_ICL3$ICL
y <- HCV_ICL3$BioS
```
Calculate the means and difference between the two sets (x and y)
```{r Mean}
# derive difference
mean(x)
mean(y)
# mean Ref_lab - mean Home_lab
mean(x)-mean(y)
```
Because n=8 is small, the distribution of the differences should be approximately normal. Check using a boxplot and QQ plot. 
There is some skew.
```{r Boxplot}
boxHCV
normHCV
lineHCV
```
Shaphiro test of normality. 
```{r Shapiro}
shapHCV
```
The normality test gives p < 0.001, which is small, so we 
reject the null hypothesis that the values are distributed normally. 

This means that we cannot use the student t-test. Instead, use the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test, we can decide whether the population distributions are identical without assuming them to follow the normal distribution.
```{r Wilcoxon}
wilcHCV
```
p > 0.05 and therefore the H0 is NOT rejected. 
The two populations are identical.

Just to see what happens in the Student T-test.
A paired t-test: one sample, two tests
H0 = no difference; H1 = mean of 2 tests are different
mu= a number indicating the true value of the mean 
(or difference in means if you are performing a two sample test).
```{r t-test}
studtHCV
```
p = 0.8425. Because p is larger than alpha, we do NOT reject H0.
In other words, it is unlikely the observed agreements happened by chance. 
However, because the populations do not have a normal distribution, we can not use the outcome if this test.

For correlation, three methods are used: pearson, kendall and spearman at a confidence level of 95%.
```{r Correlation}
# correlation of the two methods
corHCV
```
The correlation with the spearman test is 0.9868827. Almost perfect correlation. 
```{r,echo=FALSE,results="hide"}
# drop first column
HCV_ICL3$Nr <- NULL
```
Plotting the two methods using logarithmic scales.
```{r Plotting}
plot(g)
```
Summary data on the correlation line.
```{r}
regmod <- lm(y~x, data=HCV_ICL3) ## >> HIER STOND data=HepB_Web ??<<
summary(regmod)
```
The Bland-Altman Analysis. To check if there is a bias.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
df
```
```{r}
BlandAltman(x, y,
            x.name = "Reference lab IU/ml",
            y.name = "Home lab IU/ml",
            maintit = "Bland-Altman plot for HBV count",
            cex = 1,
            pch = 16,
            col.points = "black",
            col.lines = "blue",
            limx = NULL,
            limy = NULL,
            ymax = NULL,
            eqax = FALSE,
            xlab = NULL,
            ylab = NULL,
            print = TRUE,
            reg.line = FALSE,
            digits = 2,
            mult = FALSE)
```
When the dots are around 0, the two test could be interchanged for a patient. So, the two test can be interchanged. There are, however, some outliners: large difference of viral count between the two labs.
