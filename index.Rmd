## 1. A quiz in Slidify

A simple quiz question: $sin(2pi)=$

1. _`r round(sin(2*pi),0)`_
2. 1
3. -1
4. $\infty$

*** .hint

![alt text](assets/img/unit.png)

*** .explanation

The sinus is the vertical distance of a point on a unit circle.

## 2. Pretty neat but ...


* Can we get a random question from a set of questions?

--- &radio

## 3. Let's see ...

```{r echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}

question <<- c("What is the capital of Love?", "In what country did Shakespeare live and work?", "What's the purpose of human life?")
correct <<- c("Paris, mon Dieu!", "Great Britain", "Paying taxes")
alt1 <<- c("London, you fool!", "USA", "Love")
alt2 <<- c("Berlin, ohnehin!", "Italy", "See Napels and die")
alt3 <- c("My place, cherry!", "Oosterbeek (where's that!?)", "God only knows!")
hint <<- c("Another croissant, ma cherie?", "It'wasn't in the USSR", "This hint costs you 100$ incl. VAT")
answer <<- c("Does Love need a place?", "Where they eat beans at breakfast", "Ask your local tax authority")
n <<- sample(1:3,size=1)
```
A sampled quiz question: `r question[n]`

1. _`r correct[n]`_
2. `r alt1[n]`
3. `r alt2[n]`
4. `r alt3[n]`

*** .hint

`r hint[n]`

*** .explanation

`r answer[n]`

## 4. So, yes we can!

* But can we randomize the order of the answers?
* Not in Slidify

## 5. Enter Shiny!

Shiny has the interactivity and the quiz elements (like radio buttons)

With some simple R code you can sample from a set of questions and return the answers in random order.

```{r echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
qtn <- c("What is the capital of Love?",
                "In what country did Shakespeare live and work?",
                "What's the purpose of human life?")
  
  answ <- c("Paris mon Dieu!", "Great Britain", "Paying taxes")
  opt1 <- c("London you fool!", "USA", "Love")
  opt2 <- c("Berlin ohnehin!", "Italy", "See Napels and die")
  opt3 <- c("My place cherry!", "Oosterbeek (where's that!?)", "God only knows!")
  answers <- data.frame(answ, alt1, alt2, alt3)             
  p <- sample(1:3,size = 1)
  q <- sample(1:4, size = 4)
```

A scrambled quiz question: `r qtn[p]`

1. `r answers[q[1]][p,]`
2. `r answers[q[2]][p,]`
3. `r answers[q[3]][p,]`
4. `r answers[q[4]][p,]`
